# =================================================================
# fclib configuration file.
# Check https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-packages.7.html#creating-packages
# This file has been generated during fclib install and
# may be used by another cmake project to retrieve all the configuration variables
# of fclib.
#
#
# Usage :
# 
# find_package(fclib)

# # ... define some target ...
# target_link_libraries(my_target ${fclib_LIBRARIES})
#
# A call to find_package(fclib) 
# will set the following variables :
#
# fclib_INCLUDE_DIR = where to find fclib headers
# fclib_INCLUDE_DIRS : The final set of include directories listed in one variable for use by client code. It includes both path to fclib headers and path to external libraries headers
# fclib_LIBRARIES : the libraries to link against to use fclib
# fclib_EXTERNAL_LIBRARIES : the libraries on which fclib libs depend.
# fclib_ROOT : where to find the base directory of fclib
# fclib_FOUND : true if the find process went fine
# 
# 
# Note : var names chosen as recommended here :
# https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/manual/cmake-developer.7.html#manual:cmake-developer(7)

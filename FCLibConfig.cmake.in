# - config file for @PACKAGE_NAME@ package
# Written by F. PÃ©rignon, 2011 march
#
# This file generates @PACKAGE_NAME@Config.cmake, that may be used by another cmake project
# to retrieve all the configuration variables from @PACKAGE_NAME@
#
# It defines the following variables
#
# @PACKAGE_NAME@_INCLUDE_DIRS - include directories for ppmcore
# @PACKAGE_NAME@_EXTRA_INCLUDE_DIRS - path to extra headers needed for @PACKAGE_NAME@ (metis.h ...)
# @PACKAGE_NAME@_LIBRARY_DIRS - path to @PACKAGE_NAME@ library(ies)
# @PACKAGE_NAME@_LIBRARIES  - libraries to link against to use ppmcore
# @PACKAGE_NAME@_USE_XXX - value of option "USE_XXX" (for example USE_MPI, USE_Metis ... = ON or OFF)

# Tell the user where to find ppmcore headers
# Tell the user project where to find our headers and libraries
set(@PACKAGE_NAME@_INCLUDE_DIRS "${${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS}")
set(@PACKAGE_NAME@_EXTRA_INCLUDE_DIRS "${${PACKAGE_NAME}_EXTRA_INCLUDE_DIRS}")

set(@PACKAGE_NAME@_MODULE_DIR "${${PACKAGE_NAME}_INCLUDE_DIRS}/Modules")

# Our library dependencies (contains definitions for IMPORTED targets)
include("${${PACKAGE_NAME}_CMAKE_DIR}/@PACKAGE_NAME@LibraryDepends.cmake")
 
# These are IMPORTED targets created by FooBarLibraryDepends.cmake

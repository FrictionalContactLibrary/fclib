To compile and install fclib : 

cd SOME_BUILD_DIR
cmake path_to_fclib -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=where_to_install_fclib
make
make install


If you want to generate the documentation (ans web site) use -DWITH_DOCUMENTATION=ON


default value for where_to_install_fclib is /usr/local.

If hdf5 is not in a standard place, just set var HDF5_ROOT before running cmake. 
For example: 
export HDF5_ROOT=/home/install/hdf5


To run tests :

make test


To use FCLib from another project:

add in CMakeLists.txt of the project:

  find_package(FCLib 1.2 REQUIRED)
  include_directories(${FCLib_INCLUDE_DIRS})
  set(LIBS ${LIBS} ${FCLib_LIBRARY})

and run cmake like this:

cmake ... -DFCLib_DIR=where_you_install_fclib/share/CMake/

For all functions except merit ones, fclib may be used as a header
only library.

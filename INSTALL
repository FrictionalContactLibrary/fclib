To compile and install fclib : 


cd SOME_BUILD_DIR
cmake path_to_fclib -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=where_to_install_fclib
make
make install


default value for where_to_install_fclib is /usr/local.

If hdf5 is not in a standard place, just set var HDF5_ROOT before running cmake. 
For example: 
export HDF5_ROOT=/home/install/hdf5

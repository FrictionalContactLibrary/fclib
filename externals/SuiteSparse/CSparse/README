CSparse is part of SuiteSparse http://faculty.cse.tamu.edu/davis/suitesparse.html

The file csparse.c is the concatenation of all the separate c files. Then we modify the source to make it compilable with a C++ compiler.
This basically amounts to add explict cast for the allocation and a few other cosmetic change.

The other important change is that we use only csi in the ctruct css and no double.
